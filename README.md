# hello-world
This is my hello world repository. I'm a beginning to learn programming because I want to make an ambitious android application, I have the idea in my head but I have no idea how to bring to fruition. I know it will be a long (and hopefully fun) journey into software development.
So right now I'm making a series of games to create income so that I can live on my own, stop going to school and move out of my parent's place.
